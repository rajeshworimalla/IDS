## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see the date filtering section**
- Make sure you're on the `/monitoring` page
- Look for the "ðŸ“… Time Range" heading in the filters area
- It should be in the third column of the filter grid

**Q: Calendar picker isn't opening**
- Click directly on the date range trigger (the box showing the current date range)
- Make sure you're clicking on the entire trigger area, not just the text

**Q: Filtering isn't working**
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Ensure backend server is running on port 5001
- Verify database connection is working

**Q: No results showing**
- Try expanding the time range or selecting "All Time"
- Check if other filters (severity, status) are too restrictive
- Use the "Reset Filters" button to clear all filters
